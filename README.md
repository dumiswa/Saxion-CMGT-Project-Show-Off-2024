# 🧊 Ice Age – 3D Puzzle Adventure

A Unity-based 3D puzzle game developed in collaboration with an after-school care organization. **Ice Age** is inspired by children’s original character drawings and storytelling, resulting in a charming and playful puzzle experience built by a multidisciplinary team.

## 🧠 Game Concept

**Ice Age** is a family-friendly puzzle adventure game where players guide unique characters through three handcrafted levels, each filled with environmental logic puzzles and interactive challenges.

The game draws inspiration from *Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker*, focusing on spatial awareness, block-based puzzle design, and gentle exploration. It was built from the ground up by a team of 7, covering everything from engineering and level design to art, sound, and narrative.

## 👨‍💻 My Role: Engineering

As part of the development team, my primary focus was on the technical architecture and core gameplay systems. My responsibilities included:

### 🔧 Core Architecture Design
- Designed a **Monolith-style modular architecture** that structured logic across systems such as movement, puzzle interaction, resources, and UI.
- Emphasized separation of concerns and runtime safety.

### 🎮 State Machine System
- Created an extensible **state machine** system using interfaces and generics to manage gameplay logic and object behavior.
- Enabled flexible state transitions for both players and interactive objects.

### 🔄 DataBridge System
- Built a centralized **DataBridge layer** to pass gameplay data across unrelated systems (e.g., puzzle status updating UI) without tight coupling.
- Supported event-like modular updates for UI and logic syncing.

### 🧱 Mechanism System
- Engineered a **Mechanism system** to support plug-and-play interactions (e.g., pressure plates, sliding blocks, gates).
- Used observer-like patterns for responsive, reusable behavior logic.

### 🧪 Initialization & Runtime Registration
- Developed runtime **auto-registration systems** to dynamically initialize states and component references without hardcoding dependencies.
