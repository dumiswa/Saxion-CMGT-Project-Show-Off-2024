🧊 Ice Age

A 3D puzzle adventure game developed in Unity, created in collaboration with an after-school care company and inspired by children’s stories and characters.



🧠 Concept

Ice Age is a kid-friendly puzzle game where players explore three distinct levels, each filled with environmental challenges and playful logic puzzles. The game draws inspiration from Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, focusing on spatial reasoning and interactive exploration.
Developed by a team of 7, the project was built from the ground up: game design, models, textures, sound, and architecture. It reflects a full development cycle with creative input from children, who contributed character ideas and backstories.



👨‍💻 My Role: Engineering
As an engineer, my contributions focused on:

🔧 Core Architecture Design
Designed and implemented a Monolith-based architecture to modularize gameplay logic across systems like Player Movement, Interactions, Resources, and GUI.

🎮 State Machine System
Developed a generic, extensible state machine framework using C# generics and interfaces to manage gameplay and object states.

🔄 DataBridge System
Built a centralized data synchronization layer to enable modular UI updates and cross-system communication via data packets.

🧱 Mechanism System
Engineered a flexible world interaction system using "Mechanisms" and observers, supporting plug-and-play logic for environmental triggers.

🧪 Initialization + Runtime Registration
Created an Initiator and StateRegistrar system to auto-register and initialize all game states and monolith components at runtime.
